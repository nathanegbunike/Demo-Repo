Git & Github


Git - https://github.com/

open source platform... way to create & store source code (source code - what your code is where its living).

Its a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software devlopment.

designed to coordinate work between programmers and can be used to track changes in any set of files (solo).


e.g.

if you want to try out oyur new tech or make chnages, it would make a copy of the master file incase you dont want to keep new changes.

if so, you'll create a 'pull request' and the old and new will be synchronised 


e.g. 

if you have multiple programmers, you create diferent branches from the master branch.
