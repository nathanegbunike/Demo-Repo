new version of HTML:

<!doctype html>   - tells browser its an html page

<html>              - opening tag - encapsulate the html doc 

<head>              - header - dont see in browser - a description
<meta charset="utf-8">   - kind of character used on this page
<title>
</head>

<h1>   </h1>     - elements - with largest text
<p>    </p>      - element
</body>

</html>



CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

used for describing presentation of a document written in mark up language
e.g. colour, size, underline, images & animation etc 


Cascading - refers to which style rules apply if more than one rule mataches a particular element 
e.g. - make a rule that H1 tag is going to be red
	but you make the H1 green down the page.

green will overwrite red as its cascading DOWN 


a seperate style sheet is best practise. enables sepration of presentaion and content 
provides:

- more flexibility 
- multiple webpages share formatting (in seperate .css file)
- reduces complexity & repititon in structual HTML page
- present same markup page in differnet styles - for rendering methods e.g. devices



Responsive Web Design

web pages ar fully functional on all sized devices



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Begining in HTML

H1 - 6 

shows all the different sizes h1 being largest 

These are 'block' elements - meaning they'll go to the next line without a breakline

<div> element is a container - can contain other elemenets


<div class="">
  
</div>


<section>
  <p>This is a paragraph with normal sized text</p>
  <i>This is Italic</i>
  <em>This is emphasised text</em>
  <strong>This is bold</strong>
  <b>This is also bold text with a b</b>
</section>

the elements above are inline
	to seperate this, you can add a <br> - a single element


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Links & Navigaton


a - is your link tag 

<a href=""> needs an element to be clickable</a>



can be used as an internal link:

<a href="about.html">Link to internal page</a>

above will take you to about.html an internal link e.g. for a navigation bar



Navigation Bar

there are two type of lists:


- unordered list - list of items with bullet points - <ul>
- ordered - with numbers

each will have a denoted item - list item - <li>

<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <a href="index.html"><li>Home</li></a>
      <a href="about.html"><li>About</li></a>

HTML Images


two ways to add images

- saving to desktop/remote access
- copying the address image from a image online


images


<img src="" 	- image source or link 
	alt=""> - file description


<img src="AutomAteDnB" alt="AutomAteDnB" height="300">

can use the 'height' after the alt to resize your images


<a href="automate-dnb.co.uk"><img src="AutomAteDnB" alt="AutomAteDnB" height="300"></a>

The above shows a clickable image, by placing the image source within a href and the 
closing 'a' tag
